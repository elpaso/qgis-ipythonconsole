about=This plugin adds a Python console based on IPython.
    IPython has full introspection support and TAB completion, syntax highlight, online help ad a lot of cool features you will love! Optionally, this plugin creates more "pythonic" interface to Qgs classmethods for an easier introspection and TAB completion of Qgs classes.

    Note: you must separately install IPython and IPython Qt console to use this plugin. On a Debian-like distributions this is as easy as running "pip install 'ipython[all]==3.1.0 qtconsole' or (better) "pip install jupyter==1.0.0 qtconsole". To install packages with 'pip' you may need root/admin privileges.
